Unless specified, pr0xy does not support projects post-mint, and is often off-boarded for an in-house team funded by the project's initial minting raise. Occasionally, pr0xy may provide periodic updates on the existing tech-stack such as website or Discord bots until the project has taken on a full-time development team.
